A Dark Room
===========
> "awake. head throbbing. vision blurry. come light the fire."

a minimalist text adventure game for your browser

I do not own this game. All credits go to doublespeakgames. I simply forked it to Dockerize it, maybe clean it up and add some features to it in the future. 

Running it with Docker is simple as heck. 

```docker
docker run -p 8080:80 tijmen34/a-dark-room
```

This will make the game available under port 8080!
